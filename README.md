# Sticky Notes Application

A Sticky Notes application built with React JS and React JS Material UI (MUI). This application enables users to create, edit, and delete digital sticky notes, replicating the experience of physical sticky notes. The application comes with a variety of features and functionality to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Create Sticky Notes**: Users can create digital sticky notes, just like physical ones.

- **Customizable Colors**: Allow users to change the color of sticky notes to suit their preferences.

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Implement drag-and-drop functionality to easily reposition notes on the screen.

- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication to save and associate notes with specific users, ensuring data privacy.

- **Archiving**: Give users the ability to archive sticky notes for future reference or organization.

## Functionality

- **Note Display**: The application displays the content of each sticky note, making it easy for users to view their notes at a glance.

- **Editing**: Allow users to edit the content of sticky notes, providing flexibility in managing their information.

- **Deletion**: Users can delete unwanted sticky notes, enabling efficient organization.

- **Search and Filter**: Implement search and filter functionality to help users quickly locate specific notes.

- **Attachments**: Allow users to attach files, images, or links to their notes, adding context and references to their notes.

- **Dark Mode**: Offer a dark mode option for users who prefer a darker interface, enhancing accessibility and user experience in low-light environments.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
